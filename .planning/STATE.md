# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-26)

**Core value:** A LeetCode user grinding in the terminal can open one view and instantly see whether they're improving and keeping it up — solve streak, recent counts, and breakdown by difficulty/topic — backed by their real submission history, owned locally.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Submission Store & Backfill

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Submission Store & Backfill)
Plan: 0 of 3 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-06-26 — Roadmap created; 18/18 v1 requirements mapped across 3 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: — min
- Total execution time: 0.0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Scope = per-problem history feeding a global dashboard (both), not one or the other
- Data source = hybrid: backfill from LeetCode once, then append leettui submissions
- Store history in the existing SQLite/Drizzle DB (in `questions.db`) via a new versioned migration
- Dashboard north star = consistency & trajectory (streaks, counts, trends), not percentile chasing

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- [Phase 1] Real rate-limit threshold and `submissionList` field set/pagination-at-scale are LOW-confidence — a live spike (against a 500+ submission account) is scheduled in plan 01-02 to validate before locking the inter-page delay.
